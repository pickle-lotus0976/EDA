## üìñ About This Repository

This repository serves as a personal portfolio and learning log for various FPGA designs. Each top-level folder contains a distinct, self-contained Vivado project. The focus is on creating clean, reproducible, and well-documented hardware designs.

### Directory Structure

The repository is organized as a monorepo, with each project in its own directory:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore          \# Ignores Vivado's generated files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           \# This file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ full\_adder/         \# Project 1: A 1-bit Full Adder
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ universal\_gates/    \# Project 2: Universal Logic Gates (NAND/NOR)

## üöÄ Projects Included

Here is a summary of the designs contained in this repository.

### üìÅ `full_adder/`

* **Description:** A fundamental 1-bit full adder circuit that computes the sum of three binary inputs (A, B, Cin) and produces a sum (S) and a carry-out (Cout).
* **Key Files:**
    * `src/full_adder_core.v`: The main RTL module for the full adder logic.
    * `sim/tb_full_adder.v`: The testbench used to verify the design.
    * `constrs/constraints.xdc`: Pin constraints for a target board. ### üìÅ `universal_gates/`

* **Description:** Implementation of universal logic gates (NAND and NOR) from which all other logic gates can be constructed.
* **Key Files:**
    * `src/nand_gate.v`: The RTL module for a 2-input NAND gate.
    * `src/nor_gate.v`: The RTL module for a 2-input NOR gate.
    * `sim/tb_universal_gates.v`: A testbench for verifying both gates.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements & Toolchain

To work with these projects, you will need the following software installed:

* **FPGA Synthesis Tool:** [AMD Vivado 2023.2](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html) * **Version Control:** [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

| Tool         | Version   | Operating System |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|
| AMD Vivado   | `2023.2`  | Windows 11       |
| Git          | `2.4x.x`  | Windows 11       |

## ‚ö° Getting Started

These projects are designed to be fully reproducible from the source files using a Tcl script. **Do not open the `.xpr` file directly if it exists.** Instead, follow these steps to regenerate a project:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/FPGA_Designs.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/FPGA_Designs.git)
    cd FPGA_Designs
    ```

2.  **Launch Vivado:**
    Open the Vivado GUI.

3.  **Recreate the Project:**
    In the Vivado Tcl Console, run the `build_project.tcl` script corresponding to the project you want to open.

    For the **Full Adder** project:
    ```tcl
    source ./full_adder/scripts/build_project.tcl 
    ```

    This will create the Vivado project file (`.xpr`) and add all the necessary source, simulation, and constraint files automatically.
